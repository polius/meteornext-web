      <div style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Compliance with the laws</div>
      <p>PoliusCorp fully complies with the Spain privacy laws and the GDPR.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Data Location and Transfer</div>
      <p>meteornext.io data are held on servers located within the European Union. Data originating in the European Union remains within the European Union. Service Data access is restricted to members of our staff.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Customer support system</div>
      <p>Our customer support and email services are hosted primarily in the Europe Union.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Third-Party Data Processors</div>
      <p>Your Secure and Service data are held by third-party data processors, who provide us with hosting and other infrastructure services. The locations of these are described above. In many cases (but we cannot promise that this will always be the case) even Service data held by these entities is encrypted with keys held only by us.</p>
      <p>Data needed to process payments is collected by our payment processor, Stripe, Inc., which conforms to the U.S.-E.U. Privacy Shield Framework. See <a href="https://stripe.com/privacy-shield-policy" style="color:rgb(63, 165, 251)">https://stripe.com/privacy-shield-policy</a></p>
      <div style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Contacting You</div>
      <p>We may use your contact information, that is, the contact email address provided by you, to communicate with you about Service activity, provide support, and send you other information such as product updates and announcements. You may choose to stop receiving communications from us, except certain important notifications such as billing and account security alerts.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Your Responsibilities for Protecting Your Data</div>
      <p>When you create a Meteor Next account you will receive a License Access and Secret Key. Your License keys are generated on your computer and your Account Password is something you create yourself. For your protection, you should create a strong and unique Account Password to ensure that it is not easily guessed.</p>
      <p>It is extremely important that you understand that anyone with both your License Keys and Account Password can access your Account and can use your keys to register another Meteor Next application. It is equally important that you keep a copy in a safe place for your own reference, because future access to your Secure Data depends on having access to both your Secret Key and your Account Password. We will never ask you for your Account Password or your full Secret Key, and you should never send it to us or anyone.</p>
      <p>Due to the nature of our design and the sensitivity of the information you entrust to us (even in encrypted form), it may not be possible for us to help you with certain customer service requests unless you are listed as an account owner and are communicating from your verified email address. In the event that you change your email address, it is very important that you update your email on your Meteor Next account(s) or you may eventually lose access.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Data Protection Principles that We Practice</div>
      <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">(i) Your Right to Know to What We Know</div>
      <p>You have the right to know what we know about you and to see how that data is handled. You may request a screenshot of what we can see about you in our back office systems. However, to protect customer privacy, such requests must be carefully authenticated beyond demonstrating control of the customer's email address.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">(ii) Your Right to Have Your Data Erased</div>
      <p>As we are merely custodians of your data, account owners have the right to instruct us to remove data permanently from our systems. To ensure that no one's data is deleted without their consent, you must first delete your account through an authenticated session. After your account has been deleted, the account owner may contact us and ask for the data to be expunged. Once the request is authenticated, the data will be removed from our active systems within 72 hours.</p>
      <p>Disaster recovery and data availability requirements mean that PoliusCorp has a legitimate interest in maintaining secure and immutable backups. Backups are kept for 35 days. Erasure requests will leave those backups untouched, and we will only remove data from backups if legally compelled to.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:20px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.2rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">(iii) Your right to access and control your personal data</div>
      <p>You can also make choices about collection and use of your data by PoliusCorp. You can control your personal data and exercise your data protection rights by contacting PoliusCorp through the contact page (<a href="https://www.meteornext.io/contact" style="color:rgb(63, 165, 251)">www.meteornext.io/contact</a>).</p>
      <div style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Cookies and Tracking</div>
      <p>We do set and use cookies (small text files placed on your device) on our own domains and subdomains to store settings that assist with identifying your account for sign-in. We also use third-party packages and trackers for our public pages that may set cookies on your computer. These cookies are used to understand broad and anonymous user behavior when you visit meteornext.io. Such user behavior includes time spent by a visitor on the website, most visited webpage, aggregated clicks on signups etc. We also use these third-party cookies to serve more relevant advertisements to visitors once they have left the Meteor Next website on our partner sites across the web.</p>
      <p>You may disable cookies in your browser and continue to use our services without impact. We do not use third-party trackers in the Meteor Next application.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Consent for Underage Enrollment</div>

      <p>We will comply with applicable laws and the contracts with our customers to provide Service Data to law enforcement agencies. If permitted, we will notify you of such a request and whether or not we have complied. Your Meteor Account password remains encrypted with keys which we do not possess, and so we can only hand it in encrypted form.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Breach Notification</div>
      <p>In an event of a breach, we recognize our responsibility to our customers and to the public to disclose the nature of the risk and provide a transparent account of the events without undue delay. We follow applicable requirements under the laws, that is, the Spanish data privacy breach notification requirements and the requirements related to data breach notification under the GDPR.</p>
      <div style="margin-top:40px; margin-bottom:20px; font-size:1.5rem; font-weight:600; letter-spacing:-.03rem;">Updates to our Privacy Policy</div>
      <p>At our discretion, we may make changes to this Policy and note the date of the last revision. You should check here frequently if you need to know of updates to our Privacy Policy. We maintain the right to send you an email informing you of substantive changes. Previous versions will be made available from this page.</p>
